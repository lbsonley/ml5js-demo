<h2>About this site</h2>

<p>After completing the <a href="#" target="_blank">Machine Learning Course</a> on Coursera, I wanted to apply some of my newly acquired knowledge as quickly as possible. As a web developer I am already familiar with Javascript, so I was pleased to discover the ml5.js library.</p>

<p>Here you will find my experiments and explorations into client-side machine learning. Select one of the models from the navigation above to see it in action.</p>

<h2>About ml5.js</h2>

<p>According to the ml5.js documentation:</p>

<blockquote>
  ml5.js is being developed to make machine learning more accessible to a wider audience. Along with supporting education and critical engagement with machine learning
</blockquote>

<p>The ml5.js team does this by exposing common, pre-trained machine learning models like image classification, face recognition, sound classification and text sentiment analysis. By using pre-trained models, the technical knowledge required to implement machine learning algorithms is abstracted away. Users of ml5.js are then free to start building tools and seeing results almost instantly.</p>

<p>For me, ml5.js provides a quick way to deploy machine learning systems without the need to setup a server and worry about calling an API to get results from a machine learning model. Just load your model with ml5.js, give it an input, and run it.</p>

<p>This is made possible by using the web browser's built in Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), allowing client-side machine learning models to take advantage of parallel computing. <em>While this is pretty cool, the processing power is still pretty limited compared to traditionally deployed machine learning algorithm.</em></p>
